      This simple app demonstrates the Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP)
      algorithm by allowing very simple creation and authentication of users.
      For the purposes of this app, authentication is done only using a
      username and a one-time password generated using Google Authenticator or
      another TOTP-enabled client. Note that I skipped passwords entirely, but
      in real world applications one-time passwords are almost always the
      second factor, the first being a user chosen password.

          there is no cofirmation step.
